Creates a project for hybrid or native development. If `screenbuilder` and `<Type>` are not specified, creates a new project for hybrid development with Screen Builder.

### Options

* `--answers` - If set, the AppBuilder CLI looks for the specified `JSON` file and tries to pull the configuration data required by the command. If one or more required properties are not specified, the AppBuilder CLI will prompt you to provide the missing values. This option is applicable only to Screen Builder projects.
* `--no-simulator` - If set, the AppBuilder CLI does not launch the device simulator after the project is created successfully. This option is applicable only to Screen Builder projects.

### Attributes
* `<Type>` extends the `create` command. You can set the following values for this attribute.
	* `hybrid` - Creates a new project from an **Apache Cordova** template.
	* `native` - Creates a new project from a **NativeScript** template.
	* `screenbuilder` - Creates a new project for hybrid development with Screen Builder and launches the device simulator afterwards. You can later run the Screen Builder commands for project development on this project.
* `<App name>` is the name of the application. The maximum length is 30 characters. You can use only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), dot (.), hyphen (-) and space ( ).
* `<File Path>` is the absolute or relative file path to a `JSON` file which contains configuration information about your project.<% if(isHtml) { %> The file must comply with the JSON specification described in detail [here](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/creating-your-project/screen-builder-automation#create).<% } %>
