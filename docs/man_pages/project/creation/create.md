### Options

* `--answers` - If set, the Telerik AppBuilder CLI looks for the specified `JSON` file and tries to pull the configuration data required by the command. If one or more required properties are not specified, the Telerik AppBuilder CLI will prompt you to provide the missing values. This option is applicable only to Screen Builder projects.
* `--no-simulator` - If set, the Telerik AppBuilder CLI does not launch the device simulator after the project is created successfully. This option is applicable only to Screen Builder projects.

	* `website` - Creates a new project from a **Mobile Website** template.
	* `screenbuilder` - Creates a new project for hybrid development with Screen Builder and launches the device simulator afterwards. You can later run the Screen Builder commands for project development on this project.
