### Prerequisites
Before running the iOS Simulator, verify that you have met the following requirements.
* You are running the AppBuilder CLI on macOS.
* You have installed Xcode. The version of Xcode must be compatible with the ios-sim-portable npm package on which the  AppBuilder CLI depends.  For more information, see [ios-sim-portable](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ios-sim-portable).
<% } %>
<% if((isConsole && isMacOS && (isNativeScript || isCordova)) || isHtml) { %>
### Options
* `--available-devices` - Lists all available device type identifiers for the current XCode.
* `--debug` - If set, applies the Debug build configuration. <% if(isHtml) { %> For more information about build configurations, see [build configurations](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/build-configurations/overview).<% } %>
* `--release` - If set, applies the Release build configuration. <% if(isHtml) { %>For more information about build configurations, see [build configurations](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/build-configurations/overview).<% } %>
* `--path` - Specifies the directory that contains the project. If not specified, the project is searched for in the current directory and all directories above it.
* `--certificate` - Sets the certificate that you want to use for code signing your iOS app. You can set a certificate by index or name. <% if(isHtml) { %>You must specify a certificate. The certificate must match the provisioning profile.<% } %>
* `--provision` - Sets the provisioning profile that you want to use for code signing your iOS app. You can set a provisioning profile by index or name.<% if(isHtml) { %> You must specify a provisioning profile. The provisioning profile must match the certificate. <% } %>
* `--device` - Specifies the name of the iOS Simulator device on which you want to run your app.
* `--timeout` - Sets the number of seconds that the AppBuilder CLI will wait for the iOS Simulator to start before quitting the operation and releasing the console. The value must be a positive integer. If not set, the default timeout is 90 seconds.
* `--justlaunch` - If set, does not print the application output in the console.

* `<Certificate ID>` is the index or name of the certificate as listed by `$ appbuilder certificate`
* `<Provision ID>` is the index or name of the provisioning profile as listed by `$ appbuilder provision`
* `<Device Name>` is the name of the iOS Simulator device on which you want to run your app as listed by `$ appbuilder emulate ios --available-devices`
