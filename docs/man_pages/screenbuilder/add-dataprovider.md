Usage | Synopsis
------|-------
General | `$ appbuilder add-dataProvider` [--answers <File Path>]

Connects your project to a Telerik Backend Services, JSON, OData or a Progress Data Services data provider. <% if(isHtml) { %>After you configure the data provider, you can use it in your code or use it with the `add-list`, `add-signin` and `add-signup` commands to generate lists, sign-in and sign-up forms connected to the data provider. An interactive prompt guides you through the setup process.<% } %>
<% if(isConsole) { %>WARNING: This command is applicable only to Apache Cordova projects created with Screen Builder.<% } %>

### Options

* `--answers` - If set, the AppBuilder CLI looks for the specified `JSON` file and tries to pull the configuration data required by the command. If one or more required properties are not specified, the AppBuilder CLI will prompt you to provide the missing values.

### Attributes

* `<File Path>` is the absolute or relative file path to a `JSON` file which contains configuration information about your project.<% if(isHtml) { %> The file must comply with the JSON specification described in detail [here](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/creating-your-project/screen-builder-automation#add-dataprovider).<% } %>

<% if(isHtml) { %>
### Prerequisites

* Verify that you have installed git on your system.

### Command Limitations

* You can run this command only on projects created with Screen Builder.
* You cannot use this command to modify projects created with earlier versions of the AppBuilder CLI. This behavior will be fixed in an upcoming release.
