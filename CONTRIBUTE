*Help us improve the Telerik AppBuilder CLI* 

[![Telerik AppBuilder](ab-logo.png "Telerik AppBuilder")](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder "The Telerik AppBuilder web site")

The Telerik AppBuilder CLI lets you build, test, deploy, and publish hybrid mobile apps for iOS and Android from your favorite IDE or code editor. You can develop your projects locally from the convenience of your favorite code editor and run the command-line to test, build, deploy in the simulator or on devices, and publish your applications to App Store or Google Play.
